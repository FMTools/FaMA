					Environment Framework
				</h3>

				<p>This guide was developed and tested for FAMA Framework 1.2
					using Eclipse Modeling Tools IDE Kepler Release on OS X 10.9 with
					Java 1.7 and the most recent release of the necessary plug-ins as
					of May 2014. All of the requirements are summarized in the table
					below.</p>
				<p>You may use any package solution of the Eclipse IDE; just
					make sure to grab the correct 32-bit or 64-bit version depending on
					your machine. It is also suggested to use JDK 5 or newer.</p>
				<p>
					Before getting started, you will need to install a couple Eclipse
					plug-ins to help with development. You can use the normal Eclipse
					process to install these plug-ins through the menu option
					<code>Help » Install New Software...</code>
				<ul>
					<li>A Git plugin (e.g. EGit) (Update site:
						http://download.eclipse.org/releases/kepler/ under the
						Collaboration category) or, if you prefer, a standalone Git client
						(e.g. SourceTree)</li>
					<li>The Eclipse Maven plug-ins m2e (Maven Integration for
						Eclipse) and m2e - slf4j (over logback logging) (Update site:
						http://download.eclipse.org/releases/kepler/ under the
						Collaboration category)</li>
					<li>ANTLR UI (Update site:
						http://antlreclipse.sourceforge.net/updates/)</li>
					<li>ANTLR plugin for Eclipse 2.7.6. Note: ANTLR plugin for
						Eclipse 2.7.6 is not available through an Eclipse update site. You
						must download it from
						http://sourceforge.net/projects/antlreclipse/ and manually install
						the jar by placing it in the plugins folder found in your
						Eclipse’s installation folder.</li>
				</ul>

					Framework source code from GitHub using EGit
				</h4>

				<p>
				<ol>
					<li>Switch to the Git perspective in Eclipse.</li>
					<li>Click the button <code>Clone a Git Repository</code> and type the URL
						https://github.com/ISA-Research-Group/FaMA. It is strongly
						recommended you fork the project from this URL and check out the
						code from the fork. This will make it easier to contribute changes
						back to the main project later. To create a fork you need to sign
						up (create an account) or sign in to GitHub. After that you can go
						back to the FAMA Framework’s GitHub page and click on the <code>Fork</code>
						button at the top right corner. Then in Eclipse’s <code>Clone a Git
						Repository</code> wizard type the URL of your fork.</li>
					<li>The <code>Host</code> and <code>Repository</code> path fields should populate
						automatically. Click <code>Next ></code>.</li>
					<li>Keep the <code>develop</code> branch ticked and untick the other
						checkboxes. Click <code>Next ></code>. (The <code>master</code> branch is for release
						purposes only and doesn’t contain additional source files required
						for development)</li>
					<li>Make any changes you wish in the Local Destination
						dialogue and click <code>Finish</code>.</li>
					<li>Wait for the FAMA repository to be cloned.</li>

					Extensions Layer
				</h4>

				<p>
					Since the FAMA Framework is component-oriented, it allows for its
					easy extension to functionality and feature model support through
					new components that are known as FAMA Extensions. This FAMA
					Extensions will live in the FAMA Extensions Layer. Currently the
					FAMA Framework includes several FAMA Extensions that provide
					support for creating feature models conforming to various feature
					metamodels, operations over feature models, reasoners, and model
					transformations. Metamodel extensions provide different approaches
					to represent a feature model; supported metamodels are <a
						href="http://gsd.uwaterloo.ca/fmp">Czarnecki’s
						cardinality-based feature models</a>, <a
						href="http://www.moskitt.org/eng/que-es-moskitt/">Moskitt</a> and
					an own FAMA metamodel. Operation extensions specify concerns that
					arise when handling feature models and that need to be solved, such
					as what products can be derived from a given feature model or are
					there any errors present in the feature model. Operation extensions
					are used closely with reasoner extensions. A reasoner is meant to
					execute the operations over feature models and obtain the required
					information or properties from it. There are different techniques
					to perform these operations, and the constraint satisfaction
					problem technique is one of them. Reasoner extensions are usually
					implemented to use a specific technique, for example through out
					this guide we will be developing a new reasoner to support the
					analysis of feature models represented through constraint
					satisfaction problems; following sections will explain more about
					what constraint satisfactions problems are and how are they used to
					build a representation of feature models. Anyone can create a FAMA
					Extension that extends the framework in one of these aspects or
					create one for an entirely new purpose. For more detail on the FAMA
					Extensions available please refer to [Jesús García Galán. FaMa
					Framework (MSc. Thesis). Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingeniería
					Informática, Departamento de Lenguajes y Sistemas Informáticos,
					Universidad de Sevilla. 2009.].

					<a name="overview-csp" class="anchor" href="overview-csp"><span
						class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2.3 Overview of a Constraint
					Satisfaction Problem representation of feature models
				</h4>

				<p>
					A Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) is defined as a three-tuple
					composed of a set of problem variables, a set of domain values for
					each of the variables, and a set of constraints over those
					variables that restrict the values they can take. A CSP is solved
					by the assignment of a value to every variable in its domain
					through search and propagation in such way that all constraints are
					simultaneously satisfied. A feature model can be mapped to a CSP.
					The features from the feature model will be represented as
					variables with a domain equivalent to its specific cardinality. The
					representations for the relationships are as follows (more detail
					about these representations can be found <a
						href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.is.2010.01.001">here</a>):
				<dl>
					<dt>Mandatory:</dt>
					<dd>A mandatory relation between a parent feature and its
						child can be represented with the logical expression parent
						present ⇔ child present.</dd>
					<dt>Optional:</dt>
					<dd>An optional relation between a parent feature and its
						child can be represented with the logical expression parent not
						present ⇒ child not present.</dd>
					<dt>Set:</dt>
					<dd>A set constraint between a parent feature and its children
						with cardinality [x,y] can be represented with the logical
						expression (parent present ⇒ x ≤ ∑children present ≤ y) ∧ (parent
						not present ⇒ children not present), equivalent to an
						if-then-else. Both the Alternative and Or cases are handled by
						this expression.</dd>
					<dt>Requires:</dt>
					<dd>A Requires relation between an origin feature and its
						destination can be represented with the logical expression origin
						present⇒destination present.</dd>
					<dt>Excludes:</dt>
					<dd>An Excludes relation between an origin feature and its
						destination can be represented with the logical expression
						¬(origin present ∧ destination present) that can also be expressed
						as origin present ⇒ destination not present.</dd>
				</dl>
				A product that can be derived from the feature model represented as
				a CSP is, thus, one of the possible solutions to the CSP.
