					Framework
				</h3>

				<p>
					<a href="http://www.isa.us.es/fama/?FaMa_Framework">FAMA</a>
					(FeAture Model Analyzer) is an open source Java framework under
					LGPLv3 license for the automated analysis of feature models. It
					provides useful information extracted from these models, such as
					the number of products that can be derived from them, and possible
					errors they may have. FAMA is developed as OSGi plug-ins, which
					allow an easier development and assembly. The framework has three
					layers, as shown in Figure 1, namely public interfaces, SPL Core
					and FAMA Extensions. The SPL Core provides the necessary services
					to allow interoperation between the extension modules but keeping
					them uncoupled. The extensions layer is composed of various
					modules, such as metamodels, operations and reasoners to name a
					few.

				</h4>

				<p>A feature model is a hierarchical tree structure representing
					all the products that can be derived from a Software Product Line
					(SPL) in terms of “features”. Features are distinctive
					characteristics of a software system. Every feature model comprises
					features and the relationships among them. The first feature in the
					feature model, called the root feature, is used to identify the SPL
					and should always be present in every product. The remaining
					features emerge from this root feature in a hierarchical tree
					structure. Relationships between features may be of two types. On
					the one hand, parental relationships, i.e. between a parent feature
					and its child features. Parental relationships can be categorized
					as mandatory, optional or set. On the other hand, non-parental
					relationships, also known as cross-tree constraints. The most
					common cross-tree constraints are requires and excludes. All these
					features are defined as follows:
				<dl>
					<dt>Mandatory</dt>
					<dd>A mandatory relationship states that if a parent feature
						is present in a product its child feature must be present too.</dd>
					<dt>Optional</dt>
					<dd>An optional relationship states that if a parent feature
						is present in a product its child feature may or may not be
						present.</dd>
					<dt>Set</dt>
					<dd>A set of child features has a set relation with their
						parent when a number of them can be included in the products in
						which its parent feature appears. The amount of child features
						that may be included is given by the relation cardinality. The
						relation cardinality is expressed as a range of values [x,y],
						where x ≤ y and y ≤ number of child features. Two special cases of
						set relations can be identified: Alternative and Or relations.</dd>
					<dt>Alternative</dt>
					<dd>A set of child features have an Alternative relation with
						their parent when only one child can be present when its parent
						feature is present in the product. In this case the relation
						cardinality can be expressed as [0,1].</dd>
					<dt>Or</dt>
					<dd>A set of child features have an Or relation with their
						parent when one or more of them can be present when its parent
						feature is present in the product. In this case the relation
						cardinality can be expressed as [0,n], where n is the number of
						child features.</dd>
					<dt>Requires</dt>
					<dd>A requires relationship is a cross tree constraint that
						states that if feature A requires feature B then if feature A is
						present in a product, feature B must be present too.</dd>
					<dt>Excludes</dt>
					<dd>An excludes relationship is a cross tree constraint that
						states that if feature A excludes feature B then features A and B
						can not be present at the same time in a product.</dd>

					Extensions Layer
				</h4>

				<p>Since the FAMA Framework is component-oriented, it allows for
					its easy extension to functionality and feature model support
					through new components that are known as FAMA Extensions. This FAMA
					Extensions will live in the FAMA Extensions Layer. Currently the
					FAMA Framework includes several FAMA Extensions that provide
					support for creating feature models conforming to various feature
					metamodels, operations over feature models, reasoners, and model
					transformations. Metamodel extensions provide different approaches
					to represent a feature model; supported metamodels are Czarnecki’s
					cardinality-based feature models , Moskitt and an own FAMA
					metamodel. Operation extensions specify concerns that arise when
					handling feature models and that need to be solved, such as what
					products can be derived from a given feature model or are there any
					errors present in the feature model. Operation extensions are used
					closely with reasoner extensions. A reasoner is meant to execute
					the operations over feature models and obtain the required
					information or properties from it. There are different techniques
					to perform these operations, and the constraint satisfaction
					problem technique is one of them. Reasoner extensions are usually
					implemented to use a specific technique, for example through out
					this guide we will be developing a new reasoner to support the
					analysis of feature models represented through constraint
					satisfaction problems; following sections will explain more about
					what constraint satisfactions problems are and how are they used to
					build a representation of feature models. Anyone can create a FAMA
					Extension that extends the framework in one of these aspects or
					create one for an entirely new purpose. For more detail on the FAMA
					Extensions available please refer to [Jesús García Galán. FaMa
					Framework (MSc. Thesis). Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingeniería
					Informática, Departamento de Lenguajes y Sistemas Informáticos,
					Universidad de Sevilla. 2009.].</p>
